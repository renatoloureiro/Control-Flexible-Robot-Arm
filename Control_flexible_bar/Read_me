 Instructions:
 	The basic file for the analysis if the control part of the project is the 
 	'demo.m' which imports the data from the estimated model and the real one.
 	For validation of the regulater and observer, it is used the simulink file
 	'Control_Validation.slx' and for the overall lqg and dead zone non linear
 	charateristic it is used the 'Control_Scheme.slx' file.
 	
 	For the model estimation, just run the 'BasicSim.m' or the 'Identification
 	Algorithm_best.m' - there will be a better explanation inside each file.
 	
 	
 	
 	
 Note:
 	The file LQE_LQR_par.m it is the same has the demo.m but has less information,
 	must use the 'demo.m' to import and to necessary operations
